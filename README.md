# wifi-hunt

This is a Command Line Interface data gem project, the first in a series of Portfolio Projects made as part of my Fullstack Web Development program at Flatiron School.

As my digital nomadery credentials continue to add up, I find myself frequently in need of some local WiFi. Of course, keeping with the times I have a great little MiFi router (The Netgear 810s) which I throw a local data sim into. Still I'm found short though, and whilst there are several mobile apps to locate free WiFi, there's not much left for desktop browsing. There used to be a great one but it has disappeared!

I will be using data from http://www.wififreespot.com/ to populate this gem, it is not the most comprehensive list of hotspots but it is a start!

Play nice, it's my first actual program made from complete scratch!

If you find it at all useful or even just interesting, I'd love to hear from you!
